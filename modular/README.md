# Modular

A simple package that does basic finite field, modular arithmetic under the hood. For integer operations use the modular.Int type and methods (which follow along pretty closely to the big.Int basic methods)

For basic matrix operations with finite field elements (scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, and inverses) use the modular.matrix methods.
